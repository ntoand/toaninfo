title: Collision detection and path finding of powered mobility aids inside buses using 3D scans
keywords: visualisation, bus, mobility aids, collision detection, path finding
---

### **Platforms:** Windows, Linux, MacOS

### **Built with:** C++, OpenSceneGraph, Bullet Physics, Unity 3D

The aim of this work is to demonstrate how existing 3D technologies can be applied to determine the compatibility of powered mobility aids for access on buses.
Details can be found in: Carolyn A.Unsworth, Julian Chua, Anjum Naweed, Prasad Gudimetla, **Toan D.Nguyen**, David G.Barnes, "Use of 3D scanning technology to determine bus access for people using powered mobility aids," *Journal of Transport & Health*, 2018, 2214-1405, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jth.2018.07.002  

### **Features**

- Render collisions between mobility aids and buses 3D models
- Display all locations a powered mobility aid can access inside a bus
- Show how a powered mobility aid can travel between locations inside a bus
