title: Encube - Large-scale comparative visualisation
---

### **Platforms:** Linux, MacOS

### **Built with:** Script, C/C++, s2plot, python

I contributed to the development, testing and data preparation for the project. I have extracted tractography for more than 800 subjects from Human Connectome Project data using High Performance Computing <a href="https://www.massive.org.au/" target="_blank">MASSIVE</a>.

## Introduction

> encube <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> —a qualitative, quantitative and comparative visualisation and analysis system, with application to high-resolution, immersive three-dimensional environments and desktop displays. encube extends previous comparative visualisation systems by considering: (1) the integration of comparative visualisation and analysis into a unified system; (2) the documentation of the discovery process; and (3) an approach that enables scientists to continue the research process once back at their desktop. Our solution enables tablets, smartphones or laptops to be used as interaction units for manipulating, organising, and querying data. We highlight the modularity of encube, allowing additional functionalities to be included as required.

## Features

- provided a visual overview of the entire data cube survey, or a sufficiently large sub-set of the survey
- allowed qualitative, quantitative, and comparative visualisation
- supported interaction between the user and the data, including volume rotation, translation and zoom, modification of visualisation properties (colour map, transparency, etc.), and interactive querying
- supported different ways to organise the data, including automatic and manual organisation of data within the display space, as well as different ways of sorting lists using metadata included with the dataset;
- could utilise stereoscopic displays to enhance comprehension of three-dimensional structures;
- allowed a single data cube to be selected from the survey and visualised at higher-resolution;
- encouraged collaborative investigation of data, so that a team of expert researchers could rapidly identify the relevant features;
- was extensible (i.e., easily customizable) so that new functionalities can be easily be added as required;
- automatically tracked the workflow, so that the sequence of interactions could be recorded and then replayed;
- was sufficiently portable that a single solution could be deployed in different display environments, including on a standard desktop computer and monitor.
